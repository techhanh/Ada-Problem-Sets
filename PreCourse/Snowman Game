# Part 1

Directions:
1. The user is presented with a list of underscores "_". Each Underscore represents one letter in a word.
2. The user guesses letters for the hidden word
    - For each correct guess, a letter will be replace the corresponding underscore.
    - For every wrong guess we are going to remember the number of wrong guesses and print out more and more of a snowman drawing.
3. When the snowman is finished and the user is out of guesses, they lose the game.
4. Use the constant SNOWMAN_WORD
