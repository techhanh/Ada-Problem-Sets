Write a function `build_a_dictionary` that takes two arguments, a list of keys and a list of values. The function has the following behavior:
    - Verify that the inputs are valid (the inputs are valid if the two lists match in length)
    - Create a new dictionary that contains all of the keys and values
    - The keys and values must be matched in order, ie, the key at index 0 in the key list goes with the value at index 0 in the value list
    - Return the new dictionary or None if the inputs are not valid
