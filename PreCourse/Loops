# Write a function `print_ten` that takes one argument, a string. The function has the following behavior:
    - The function returns a string that repeats a counter number (starting at 1) and then the string ten times (all in 1 string)
    - The function can use either a while loop or a for loop, but it must use a loop


# pseudocode
# define the function name with one parameter
# create a counter variable and assign it as 1 to start the count
# create a result variable to store a blank string in (this is use to increment itself later)
# create a while loop and set the counter to exclusively 11 (so output will be from 1 to 10)
# to repeat the string, use the result variable to concentrate together that variable, the counter variable (that is formatted to a string), an empty space string (to separate the previous count from the string), the parameter, and another empty space string (to separate the string from the next incremental count)
# to increment the count, use the count variable to increment itself by 1
# return the result variable to get the output
# print and call the function with its argument to show the final output

def print_ten(string):
  counter = 1
  result = ""
  while counter < 11:
    result += str(counter) + " " + string + " "
    counter += 1
  return result

print(print_ten("snow"))
print(print_ten(""))
print(print_ten("123"))
