# Write a function `count_item_in_list` that takes two arguments, an item and a list called list_of_items. The function has the following behavior:
    - The function returns the number of times the item appears in the list
    - If the list does not contain the item, the function returns 0 .
    
# pseudocode for scenario 1:
# define the function with the 2 parameters (the item and the list of items)
# create a variable to show the number of times an item appears in the list and set this count as 0
# create a for loop to go through all the elements/index in the list of items
# (under the for loop) use an if statement to check if the elements/index matches the item
# (if it does) increment the number of times an item appears in list variable to itself and increase by 1
# (outside of the for loop) return the number of times an item appear in list variable
# call the function with the arguments
