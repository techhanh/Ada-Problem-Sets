Lets say we are working on an algorithm to compare two lists and find the elements that are common to both. One way to code it without using sets:

bethan_movies  = ["Candyman", "Free Guy", "Old", "Luck by Chance", "Billu"]
hussain_movies = ["Old", "Billu", "Gulaal", "Blue", "Fruit & Nut", "Wonder Woman"]
result_list = []

for movie in bethan_movies:
    if movie in hussain_movies:
        result_list.append(movie)

print(result_list)



#Another way to code return the same result using set and a reusable function:

# Psuedocode:
# Define a function with 2 parameters
# Create a new variable to turn each of the list into sets
# Create a new variable to combine the two sets by using set interaction (& operator, AKA intersection set) to all the elements that is from both sets
# (optional step) create a new variable to convert the new set into a list 
# return the list
# print to call the function with all the arguments to show all the the common movies from both list

bethan_movies  = ["Candyman", "Free Guy", "Old", "Luck by Chance", "Billu"]
hussain_movies = ["Old", "Billu", "Gulaal", "Blue", "Fruit & Nut", "Wonder Woman"] 

def common_movies(bethan_movies, hussain_movies):
  bethan_set = set(bethan_movies)
  hussain_set = set(hussain_movies)
  result_set = bethan_set & hussain_set
  result_list = list(result_set)
  return result_list
print(common_movies(bethan_movies, hussain_movies))
