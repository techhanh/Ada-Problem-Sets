#Let's say we have a string of letters and we want to find all of the unique characters in the string. Here's a way to code it without using sets:

phrase = "Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear"
result = []

for char in phrase:  # loop over each character in the string
    if char not in result: # if the character is not in the result set:
        result.append(char) # add the character to the result set

for char in result: # print out the results
    print(char)
    
  
  
#Hereâ€™s another way to code it using sets and streamline the code:

phrase = "Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear"

result_set = set(phrase)
for char in result_set:
  print(char) # Will print out the same as above but not in any specific order as it is a set
