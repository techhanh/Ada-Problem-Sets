Create a dictionary that contains all of the data in this table. Use context clues to understand what keys and values are expected (including running the test). Put that dictionary in the function get_friend_data() as a dictionary literal and return it.

def get_friend_data():
  observation = {
  "date":	"2010-06-01",
  "location":	"park",
  "crow_count":	3,
  "dog_count":	10,
  "cat_count":	0,
  "pigeon_count":	31
}
  return observation
print(get_friend_data())
