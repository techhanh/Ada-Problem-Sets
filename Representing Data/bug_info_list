#Part 1:
#Mady and Lesha track their bug information in lists. They would love to know which unique bugs each has caught. They'd like to get some sort of insect index, sort of an InsectDex containing that unique information. Write a function `make_insect_dex` that they can use to make an InsectDex for each of them. Remember that in the InsectDex, each insect should appear only once.
    
mady_bugs = ["lightning bug", "caterpillar", "ladybug", "lightning bug", "ladybug", "monarch butterfly", "june bug", "carpenter ant"]
lesha_bugs = ["stag beetle", "earwig", "millipede", "pill bug", "june bug", "lightning bug", "dragonfly"]

# Psuedocode: 
# Input is a list that has multiple duplicates, Output is a set that does not contain duplicates within its own set
# Create a function with two parameters
# Create a variable to change each of the list to a set
# Return each of the individual sets
# Print to call each of the individuals set

mady_bugs = ["lightning bug", "caterpillar", "ladybug", "lightning bug", "ladybug", "monarch butterfly", "june bug", "carpenter ant"]

print(make_insect_dex(lesha_bugs, mady_bugs))


#Part 2:
#Mady and Lesha would love to know which bugs each has caught that the other hasn't! Write a function caught_differenc2 that they can use to compare the bugs each has caught, so they can see the bugs that have only been caught by the first one of their data passed to the function.

# Pseudocode: 
# Input is 2 different list, Output is a set that does not contain duplicates or the same bugs from the other set
# Create a function with two parameters
# Create a variable to change each list into a set
# Create a variable for each set to find the differences from their own set compared to the other set (by using the - difference operator)
# Return each of the difference sets
# Print to call each of the function to show the differences of each sets


mady_bugs = ["lightning bug", "caterpillar", "ladybug", "lightning bug", "ladybug", "monarch butterfly", "june bug", "carpenter ant"]
