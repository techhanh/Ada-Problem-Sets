# Part 1:
# Mady and Lesha track their bug information in lists. They would love to know which unique bugs each has caught. They'd like to get some sort of insect index, sort of an InsectDex containing that unique information. Write a function `make_insect_dex` that they can use to make an InsectDex for each of them. Remember that in the InsectDex, each insect should appear only once.

# Psuedocode: 
# Input is a list that has multiple duplicates, Output is a set that does not contain duplicates within its own set
# Create a function with two parameters
# Create a variable to change each of the list to a set
# Return each of the individual sets
# Print to call each of the individuals set

# Part 2:
# Mady and Lesha would love to know which bugs each has caught that the other hasn't! Write a function caught_differenc2 that they can use to compare the bugs each has caught, so they can see the bugs that have only been caught by the first one of their data passed to the function.

# Pseudocode: 
# Input is 2 different list, Output is a set that does not contain duplicates or the same bugs from the other set
# Create a function with two parameters
# Create a variable to change each list into a set
# Create a variable for each set to find the differences from their own set compared to the other set (by using the - difference operator)
# Return each of the difference sets
# Print to call each of the function to show the differences of each sets

# Part 3:
# Mady and Lesha's bug excitement continues unabated! They know which bugs they caught that were distinct from one another, but would like to know which bugs they caught in common. Write a function caught_by_both that they can use to find out which bugs were caught both by Mady and by Lesha.

# Pseudocode
# Input: two list with duplicates, Output: two set that shows only the duplicates from both sets
# Create a function with 2 parameters
# Create a new variable to change each list to its own set
# Create a new variable to combine the two sets (by using the & intersection operator) to show the duplicate elements from both sets
# Return the new set
# Print the functions to show the combine elements from both sets

# Part 4:
# Mady and Lesha are really enjoying comparing their adventures! But now they'd love to know how many kinds of bugs they've caught in combination. They're pretty sure that they've caught a lot more bugs together than they have individually! Write a function caught_together that they can use to find all the bugs that they've caught: either only by Mady, only by Lesha, or by both of them!

# Pseudocode:
# Input: two different list, Output: two separate sets that has all the unique elements from both sets combined
# Create a function with 2 parameters
# Create a new variable for each list to change to a set
# Create a new variable to combine the two sets together (using the | union operator) to show all the unique elements from both set
# Return the new set
# Print each of the function to show the combine unique elements for each set
