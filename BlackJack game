**About BlackJack**

In this exercise we will write a method and set of tests in TDD fashion which calculates a hand's BlackJack score.

In the card game BlackJack each card has a value.

- Number cards (2-10) carry the card's numeric value.
- Face cards on the other hand ("Jack", "Queen", "King") have a value of 10.
- Aces (1) can have a value of either 1 or 11, whichever will get the hand closest to 21 without going over.

For example if I had a 3, a King, and an Ace, my BlackJack score is 14 (3 + 10 + 1). If I have an Ace, and a Jack then my score is 21 (11 + 10).

A hand, an array of Card values, must be between 2 and 5 items inclusive.

When a hand's score is greater than 21, the hand is a **bust** and the player automatically loses.
