**About BlackJack**

In this exercise we will write a method and set of tests in TDD fashion which calculates a hand's BlackJack score.
In the card game BlackJack each card has a value.
- Number cards (2-10) carry the card's numeric value.
- Face cards on the other hand ("Jack", "Queen", "King") have a value of 10.
- Aces (1) can have a value of either 1 or 11, whichever will get the hand closest to 21 without going over.
For example if I had a 3, a King, and an Ace, my BlackJack score is 14 (3 + 10 + 1). If I have an Ace, and a Jack then my score is 21 (11 + 10).
A hand, an array of Card values, must be between 2 and 5 items inclusive.
When a hand's score is greater than 21, the hand is a **bust** and the player automatically loses.


Part 1: Identifying Edge and Nominal Cases
Identify some of the following tests cases:
- At least two nominal cases
- At least three edge cases

My nominal test case :
1. ten, ace
2. 5, 7, 6, 2
3. queen, 5, 9

My edge test cases:
1. 4, 6, 7, 9, jack, queen
2. no card/empty list
3. ace, ace
4. 8, joker


Part 2: Identifying Edge and Nominal Cases
1. Review the test cases you identified in Part 1
2. Determine how you would test these cases

My nominal test case :
1. ten, ace - def test_return_blackjack_for_10_ace():
2. 5, 7, 6, 2 - def test_return_20_for_5_7_6_2():
3. queen, 5, 9 - def test_return_bust_for_queen_5_9():

My edge test cases:
1. 4, 6, 7, 9, jack, queen - def test_over_5_elements_returns_runtime_error_printed_Invalid():
2. no card - def test_blank_or_None_argument_returns_syntax_error_printed_Invalid():    
3. ace, ace, ace - def test_change_ace_value_of_ace_ace_ace_returns_13():
4. 8, joker - def test_nondefined_argument_8_joker_returns_syntax_error_printed_Invalid():
